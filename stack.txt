Stack

For my personal goals: support to focus, help with regulation of mood and energy (moderating variance between anxiety and depression).


=== Sidenote on DOSAGE ===

Many of these have different effect profiles, and "one dose" may have an order of magnitude differential between people.  Know standardized doses where possible. 

If you feel zero effect, give it a few days to see if there is a gentler trend to the effect (such as with magnesium or reishi), and/or possibly increase dosage.  

If you feel TOO much effect - Maybe take half that amount next time before writing it off.  

For that matter, brand-to-brand, there can be a LOT of variance between samples.  I prefer to spend more money for brands that are more established and well-regarded - My personal go-to for many of these is Nootropics Depot.  They have a subreddit, and a Podcast ("In search of insight") where they discuss the effects of these noots and the process of their discover, extraction, and use.


So here's an example of my morning stack...

=== Stimulant side ===

Coffee - 95% of days. (standard amount, I don't generally add any past noon these days).  Central Nervous System stimulant.

Sabroxy - 60% of days. MAO-B inhibition, means it follows a pathway _similar_ to adderall, less CNS stimulation than coffee.  So a good adjunct to it.

Shilajit - 50% of days. More for mood and "jing", sort of a directed energy, confidence/testosterone, versus the less-directed stimulation of coffee.  

=== Support side ===

Magnesium - 95% of days: Assistant to stimulant metabolism.  Mg Glycinate sits best with my stomach.

Co-Q10 - 95% of days: general metabolic support, + for heart health, not much risk, I couldn't tell you the biochemistry of it but it's claimed to help and it seems to decrease my body load.

Andrographis - 95% of days.  May substitute with Turmeric. Inflammation reduction, reduces body load.

Red Reishi, or White Jelly mushroom, or Lions Mane - 60% of days.  Medicinal mushrooms (no not THAT kind), generally have some support towards reducing inflammation, pain management, other subtle cellular support.  'reduced body load'. in turn, supports mood and focus peripherally.


=== Evening Time ===

Saffron*** - Mild dopamine and serotonin action, nice for support if I am feeling a bit of a mood crash in the afternoon/evening.  As needed (maybe 40% of days.)  Not a bed-time or sleepy supplement, but not too stimulating.  Morning is fine too.

Coriander extract - Similar, but more calming to the stress.  Reduced cortisol.  Can use on stressful days or evenings. Does not put you to sleep like some GABAergics, but can ease off the stress.  20% of days for me.  [Sidenote: I used this daily for a while, it reduced the effectiveness. I believe regular daily use of GABAergics to manage anxiety/activation can backfire by 'raising the floor' on activation -> more anxiety.]

Other honorable mentions for GABAergics, nice sometimes, usually evening for chill-time: Passionflower (tea or capsules), kava, chamomile, L-Theanine, Lemon Balm.


=== Substitutes for Coffee ===

Green Tea/Matcha: caffeine + natural L-theanine.  Some people feel well with the 'calming', levelling effect of theanine alone with the activation of caffeine.

Yerba Mate***: Caffeine + MAOI + ??? nice mood boost along with the activation of caffeine.  I'm blending this back in in place of coffee lately, it's honestly been one of my favorite morning stimulants.


***Due to serotonin action (from MAOI or otherwise), for those taking SSRIs like lexapro, do a little googling on this one and its combination with SSRIs.  If it looks safe you could still proceed with caution and use 1/4 dose, then 1/2 dose for a bit.


=== Cognitive Contributors ===

This is its own category for me, not necessarily strong contributors to direct focus or mood regulation, but can nonetheless be productive, mentally or emotionally.  I'd put these in the 'pseudo-psychedelic' space.  Mostly not controlled substances.

Huperzine-A: Taken before bed, can increase lucidity in dreams.  Taken in morning, can increase an aspect of 'dreaminess' to waking reality.  Has some effects on acetylcholine.  Personally I sampled this one last year, found it fascinating, and have not regularly used it since.  I was having some mild dissociative aspects that weren't supporting my intentions.

Cognance: For some may support cognitive/creative performance.  Regarded as somewhat of a '[mushroom] microdose' effect.  

Ketamine: [Controlled] Can be legally administered or prescribed, and is probably the most accessible near-psychedelic, if not a 'classic psychedelic'.  It has a host of effects, used for cessation of depression and also recreation, can induce a quality of "stepping out of your life and looking back in", with fewer fears or constraints.  I find it to be quite helpful to find perspective, and illuminate where some of my rigid thinking patterns have been.

Amanita Muscaria: Long cultural history, mildy psychedelic, not a controlled substance.  At high doses has risk of hepatotoxicity but low doses considered safe, so microdosing this has become more popular lately. [I have not tried it, I have friends who have found it very helpful]
